## Deep Learning Suite
### Purpose of Benchmark
The deep learning suite contains: CANDLE benchmark codes implement deep learning architectures that are relevant to problems in cancer; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that comprises convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers; LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that remembers values over arbitrary intervals to deal with temporal and time-series prediction; and, resnet-50 distributed training code for classification in ImageNet dataset at scale.
